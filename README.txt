+----------Short explanation-----------+
| Main Function: this application was  |
| done to allow users book classes     |
| in a GUI of my university, correct   |
| user login is not implemented because|
| is a project to put in practice the  |
| part of internationalization and     |
| a low quality design.                |
|				       |
| There's not a data base to store the |
| books info and user info since was   |
| not necessary for this project.      |
| Instead of that i used a simple      |
| vector defined in class User.java    |
| which collects all books of a user.  |
| For this simple project i used a     |
| single user and an apart file in     |
| which are all the user books which is|
| update in function of if the user    |
| book new classes or cancel others.   |
| 				       |
| For the internationalization, same   |
| as with file of books, i used a file |
| which contains whole info about text |
| language. This way we can change     |
| language at runtime with a single    |
| button in menu. For this, we use too |
| a data structure of vector to store  |
| all info about language file which is|
| assigned in the right place.         |
